presents experimental data in that regard.

# Data and data quality issues

Data provided was obtained by XYZ. It was collated by carrying out an experiment,
advertising their service for the last 10 weeks across a wide variety of social, blog, and
user content driven websites.
Data quality issues faced were:

• Presence of a major outlier handled by removal

• Missing values handled by imputing averages

• Data inconsistency, Handled by renaming inconsistent data


# Key Finding:

• Averagely, 12% of people who come across digital advertisements click on them

• the present marketing strategy is incurring a £0.25 loss on every 1000 impression

• Generally, more clicks are gotten at a higher engagement.

• When around 80 impressions are made on customers, They are a lot more likely to click compared to when less or more is made.

• Having more impressions than this, comes with a cost and may not have any marginal impact.

• Impressions above 140 are likely to yield no clicks as it shows that customer may be disinterested in what is advert.
